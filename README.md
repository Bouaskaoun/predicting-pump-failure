# Predicting Pump Failure
This project aims to predict pump failure using various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), linear support vector classification (Linear SVC), decision tree, and random forest.

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains sensor data from pumps, which is available on Kaggle. The dataset includes Timestamp data, Sensor data(52 series) and Machine status: This is target label that I want to predict when the failure will happen.

## Prerequisites
To run the code in this project, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (for visualizations)

## Algorithms
The project uses the following algorithms to predict the failure of the pumps:

- Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is a method for predicting binary outcomes, such as whether or not a pump will fail. It is a linear model that estimates the probability of an event occurring, and then makes a prediction based on that probability.

- KNN: KNN is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. The algorithm tries to find the k-nearest data points in the training set for a new data point and makes a prediction based on the majority class or average value of the k nearest data points.

- Linear SVC: Linear SVC is a method for classification. It separates the data by finding the best linear boundary between the classes.

- Decision Tree: Decision tree is a method for classification and regression. The algorithm builds a decision tree based on the training data by recursively partitioning the data based on feature values.

- Random Forest: Random forest is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve the performance of the model. It works by training multiple decision trees on random subsets of the data, and then making predictions based on the majority vote of the decision trees.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of various machine learning algorithms for predicting pump failure. The models were trained on a dataset of pump information, and their performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The results of this project can be used to improve the maintenance and operation of pumps in industrial settings, reducing the likelihood of pump failure and increasing uptime.
